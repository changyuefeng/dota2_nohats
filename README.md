## Which kinds of cosmetics are overridden where?

Data about cosmetic files is gathered from "scripts/items/items_game.txt".

The following are overridden with the default files:

* Cosmetic models from "model_player" fields
* Cosmetic summon models from "entity_model" visuals
* Cosmetic alternate hero models from "hero_model_change" visuals
* Cosmetic courier models from "courier" and "courier_flying" visuals
* Custom icons from "icon_replacement" and "ability_icon_replacement" visuals
* Custom particle snapshots from "particle_snapshot" visuals

These can be found in the following folders:

* "models/{courier,creeps,items}"
* "resource/flash3"
* "particles/models"

Custom sounds from "sound" visuals are overridden by the default sound lengthened to 2 seconds.
These can be found in the folder "sound".

Custom animations from "activity" visuals are overridden by modifying the hero models.
Note: taunt and loadout animations are not overridden.
Custom skins from "skin" visuals and "set_parent_skin" fields are overridden by modifying hero and courier model files.
These can be found in the folders "models/{heroes,props_gameplay}".

Custom particle systems come from "attached_particlesystem" visuals, "particle" visuals and unusual couriers.
They are overridden by default particle systems and reassembled into particle files.
These can be found in the folders "particles/{econ,units}".
